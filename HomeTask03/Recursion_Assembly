1. Find the sum of the following series using recursion:
2+3+5+8+12+...+n
2. Use recursion to find the nth fibonacci series element.
3. Use recursion to find the GCD of two given numbers.
4. Use recusrion to remove the duplicate occurance of characters in a string.

Output: acb
5. Use recursion to search a element in a sorted array (you will have to use binary search)
